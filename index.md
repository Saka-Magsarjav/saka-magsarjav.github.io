I am Saranzaya Magsarjav, but you can call me Saka, currently undertaking a Ph.D. in maths at the Univeristy of Adelaide. For my Ph.D. project I am looking into reproducibility and stability in topic modelling under the supervision of [Melissa Humphries](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/melissa.humphries), [Lewis Mitchell](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/lewis.mitchell#my-research), and [Jono Tuke](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/simon.tuke#publications). However, my research area is quite broad from [analysing drugs in waste water](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00532) to [quantifying civil disobidience](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2022.2034222) to [sentiment contagion](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/3/265). 


You can check out my professional activities [here](professional.qmd) and my [publications](about.qmd), or check out my [blog](first.qmd) where I write about anything that takes my fancy, usually something to do with maths.
