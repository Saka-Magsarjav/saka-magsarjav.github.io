    "text": "How I want this to go:\nThe premises of a year is too long to keep track of goals and intentions. Your brain thinks it there is a lot of time and does not get anything done. One of two things happens with year resolutions is it is forgotten after a first month or frantically tried to get back on track in the last month or so.\nBy setting up the 12 week year, it is long enough that it doesn’t seem impossible to reach your goals, but short enough that you cannot slack off.\nThis is one of the better productivity books I have read in that there were actionable items and practical tips to implement these ideas, specially if you are new to ``productivity”. However, at times it felt quite repetitive as it tried to drill in why some of the concepts are important. This probably would not be a problem for new readers. I do think that this books has great ideas however a person new to a lot of productivity tips may find it overwhelming to implement all the things the book says. This would a good book to pick a some new ideas and implement them then come back to over and over again.\nThere are 3 principles that this book states that the 12 week system is built from: accountability, commitment, and greatness in the moment. Accountability, as they describe it, is ownership of your actions, regardless of your circumstances. Commitment is keeping a promise to yourself to act on your promises. Greatness in the moment is the idea that you are not great when you have the results, it happens when you have chosen to commit to taking action and take control of your life.\nThe emotions cycle of change: - uninformed optimism - informed pessimism - valley of despair - informed optimism - success and fulfilment\n3 Principles - Accountability: ownership - Commitment: personal promise - Greatness in the moment: you become great before results"

    "text": "Visualisation and Your Why\nOne of the first exercises it gets you to do is to think about your long term goals. Thinking in terms of what does your life look like if you had no constraints. What would you be doing regarding not only your work life but personal and your relationships? If there were no constraints on time or money or external pressures, what kind of person would you be? What would you have accomplished? What does your relationships look like? What do you want your daily activities to be?\nFrom here, next is to narrow this down further to approximately over the next 5 years, 10 years and 15 years. However, still to make sure assuming everything is possible for you.\nNext is the mid-term vision of ~3 years time. Writing out everything and anything that comes to mind using your long term list as a guide. Be as specific as possible as this makes the next steps of creating a 12 week plan easier.\nDoing this helps you motivate your why’s in your daily actions."

    "text": "The 12 Week Year Process\nThe planning starts with the goals you want to accomplish for the 12 week year and tactics on how you will accomplish those with specific due dates. This is the idea of having a well-written, specific and measurable goals, and actionable items that move you towards the goals.\nWhen creating these plans, making sure that it is written out some where, be it on physical copy or typed up in any program of your choosing.\n\nYour Goals\nThis is where the 12 week year process starts of setting your goals. These goals should be the bridge between your now to your future vision, therefore align with the vision you have for yourself that is the most valuable for you.\nThe criteria for setting goals are:\n\nSpecific and Measurable: Make sure to have a quantity/quality that you want to achieve. Be able to answer How much? or How many?\nPositive Statement: Focus on what is positive that will happen.\nRealistic Stretch: Creating goals that are just slightly outside your comfort zone.\nAccountability: How a buddy or someone that will keep you accountable.\nTime bound: Have a deadline.\n\nIdeally you would not have more than 3 goals as it becomes harder and harder to keep track of everything.\n\n\nTactics\nThe tactics for a goal are the actions that make sure your goals is reached. Here brain storm all the actions you could take to complete this goals, then pick out top few steps that make most impact. This idea of impact will differ depending your values and goals, even if you have the same goal as someone else.\nThere should be tactics for each individual goals with the weeks that needs to be completed in. Tactics should be stated as a complete sentence, starting with a verb, and executable within the deadline.\nBefore moving on some questions to consider are “What actions will you struggle with?” and “What will you do to overcome them?” Setting up these question will help when inevitably you come across hurdles, you have a plan.\n\n\nScore Your Week\nAfter having tactics for each of your goals, there needs to be some way to measure your effectiveness. Measuring your progress and execution helps create informed future decisions to improvement. If you do not know where your starting point is, how will you know you have improved.\nThere are two different metrics that are used to measure how your week has progressed: lag indicators and lead indicators. Lag indicators are results you are aiming or wanting to achieve. Lead indicators are execution based, i.e., the actions you take to get these results.\nIdeally you would have both lead and lag indicators to create informative decisions as to where you are lacking. However, as you have greater control over the execution than the results, lead indicators are a more informative in determining where the a breakdown is occurring.\nOne way to score your week is using the percentage of the tactics you have achieved. The book suggest that if you complete 85% of the tactics, you are most likely to achieve your goals. The idea behind the number is that you are not striving for perfection but striving for excellence.\n\n\nWeekly Accountability Meeting (WAM)\nReport on how they tracked their goals and how they will execute it. - Your results for 12 week year to date - Your weekly execution score - Intentions for coming week - Feedback and suggestions from the group - Successful techniques: what worked well Encouragement\n\n\nModel Work Week\nModel Work week is the ideal week to get all the things you want to do done, i.e., what does you calender look like if you schedule in all the things you want to get done. However, with everything you need to adjust your schedule to be realistic. There might be events or meetings that are non-adjustable that has to be done. Schedule: - 15 min review - three hour strategic block - buffer blocks - admin work - breakout block - free time - additional responsibilities: meetings/planning/project work\nRegularly: - reconnect with vision: 5-10 min Is there still emotional connection? - 12 week review: 10-15 min Review metrics? Executing high? - Assess performance breakdowns: 10-20min Do you need to adjust plan or execute better? - Work on plan tactics (high payoff): 2-2.5 hours Complete tactics from 12 week plan - Buffer block (low busy work): 30-60min Admin worl\nThinking shift: cant do it all\nPitfalls: - you conduct business as usual - you don’t focus on one thing at a time in your strategic blocks - you allow distraction to steal your attention - You think being busy is the same as being productive\nTips: - Work from a written weekly plan - Input your model week into your calender\nread performance time - create model week - what you want your weeks to look like - don’t forget to add low value activities - email/admin - add strategic blocks first\n\n\nWhat this looks like\nTime blocking: - strategic blocks: 3 hours uninterrupted time a week - buffer blocks: unplanned low value activities: emails 30 min a day - breakout blocks: taking time away from work\nConsider when you are the best- schedule most important time during your prime\n“Intentional Imbalance” - focusing on the few\n3 Principles - Accountability: ownership - Commitment: personal promise - Greatness in the moment: you become great before results 5 Disciplines - Vision - Planning - Process Control - Measurement - Time use - intention"
