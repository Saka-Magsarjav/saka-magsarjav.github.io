However, my research area is quite broad from analysing drugs in waste water to quantifying civil disobidience to sentiment contagion.\nYou can check out my professional activities here and my publications, or check out my blog where I write about anything that takes my fancy, usually something to do with maths."

    "text": "The premises of a year is too long to keep track of goals and intentions. Your brain thinks it there is a lot of time and does not get anything done. One of two things happens with year resolutions is it is forgotten after a first month or frantically tried to get back on track in the last month or so.\nBy setting up the 12 week year, it is long enough that it doesn’t seem impossible to reach your goals, but short enough that you cannot slack off.\nThis is one of the better productivity books I have read in that there were actionable items and practical tips to implement these ideas, specially if you are new to ``productivity”. However, at times it felt quite repetitive as it tried to drill in why some of the concepts are important. This probably would not be a problem for new readers. I do think that this books has great ideas however a person new to a lot of productivity tips may find it overwhelming to implement all the things the book says. This would a good book to pick a some new ideas and implement them then come back to over and over again.\nOne interesting concept that this books says is the most important is accountability."

    "text": "Visualisation and Your Why\nOne of the first exercises it gets you to do is to think about your long term goals. Thinking in terms of what does your life look like if you had no constraints. What would you be doing regarding not only your work life but personal and your relationships? If there were no constraints on time or money or external pressures, what kind of person would you be? What would you have accomplished? What does your relationships look like? What do you want your daily activities to be?\nFrom here, next is to narrow this down further to approximately over the next 5 years, 10 years and 15 years. However, still to make sure assuming everything is possible for you.\nNext is the mid-term vision of ~3 years time. Writing out everything and anything that comes to mind using your long term list as a guide. Be as specific as possible as this makes the next steps of creating a 12 week plan easier.\nDoing this helps you motivate your why’s in your daily actions."

This is the idea of having a well-written, specific and measurable goals, and actionable items that move you towards the goals.\nWhen creating these plans, making sure that it is written out some where, be it on physical copy or typed up in any program of your choosing.\n\nYour Goals\nThis is where the 12 week year process starts of setting your goals. These goals should be the bridge between your now to your future vision, therefore align with the vision you have for yourself that is the most valuable for you.\nThe criteria for setting goals are:\n\nSpecific and Measurable: Make sure to have a quantity/quality that you want to achieve. Be able to answer How much? or How many?\nPositive Statement: Focus on what is positive that will happen.\nRealistic Stretch: Creating goals that are just slightly outside your comfort zone.\nAccountability: How a buddy or someone that will keep you accountable.\nTime bound: Have a deadline.\n\nIdeally you would not have more than 3 goals as it becomes harder and harder to keep track of everything.\n\n\nTactics\nThe tactics for a goal are the actions that make sure your goals is reached. Here brain storm all the actions you could take to complete this goals, then pick out top few steps that make most impact. This idea of impact will differ depending your values and goals, even if you have the same goal as someone else.\nThere should be tactics for each individual goals with the weeks that needs to be completed in. Tactics should be stated as a complete sentence, starting with a verb, and executable within the deadline.\nBefore moving on some questions to consider are “What actions will you struggle with?” and “What will you do to overcome them?” Setting up these question will help with"
