    "text": "I am Saranzaya Magsarjav, but you can call me Saka, currently undertaking a Ph.D. in maths at the Univeristy of Adelaide. For my Ph.D. project I am looking into reproducibility and stability in topic modelling under the supervision of Melissa Humphries, Lewis Mitchell, and Jono Tuke. However, my research area is quite broad from analysing drugs in waste water to quantifying civil disobidience to sentiment contagion.\nYou can check out my professional activities here and my publications, or check out my blog where I write about anything that takes my fancy, usually something to do with maths."
